## 📖 About

State management is the backbone of modern apps. Get it wrong, and you'll spend months debugging "ghost bugs." Get it right, and your app becomes predictable, scalable, and maintainable.

This repository breaks down state management mastery into **8 essential principles** that will transform how you build applications.

## 🎯 The 8 Principles

### 1. 🧠 **State Management is Your App's Backbone**
Get it wrong, and you'll spend months debugging "ghost bugs" where data appears and disappears mysteriously. Get it right, and your app becomes predictable, scalable, and maintainable.

### 2. 💡 **Single Source of Truth**
Every piece of data should have ONE authoritative source. When you duplicate state across components, you're asking for synchronization nightmares. One source, multiple subscribers.

### 3. 🔄 **Think in Data Flow, Not Components**
Map out how data moves through your app before writing code:
- Where does data originate?
- Who needs to read it? 
- Who can modify it?
- When should updates trigger re-renders?

### 4. ⚡ **Granular Beats Global**
Instead of one massive global state object, break it into focused, independent chunks. User profile, shopping cart, and app settings shouldn't live in the same state bucket. Fine-grained reactivity = better performance.

### 5. 🎯 **Separate Concerns Clearly**
- **Local state**: Component-specific data (form inputs, toggles)
- **Shared state**: Cross-component data (user auth, theme)
- **Server state**: API responses, cache management

Each has different patterns and tools.

### 6. 🚀 **Choose Tools That Match Your Complexity**
- **Simple apps**: React useState, Vue ref()
- **Medium complexity**: Context API, Pinia
- **Complex apps**: Redux, Zustand, MobX
- **Framework-agnostic**: Libraries like Stunk, Valtio

Don't over-engineer.

### 7. 🐛 **Debug with Time-Travel**
Good state management should let you:
- See all state changes over time
- Replay actions to reproduce bugs
- Rollback to previous states
- Track which actions caused which updates

### 8. 🎉 **Master These Patterns**
When you follow these principles, your apps will have:
- Predictable updates
- Easier debugging
- Better performance
- Simpler testing
- Happier developers

## 🔧 Quick Examples

### React with Fine-Grained State
```javascript
import { createState, createComputed } from 'stunk'

const count = createState(0)
const doubled = createComputed(() => count.value * 2)

function Counter() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count.value}</p>
      <p>Doubled: {doubled.value}</p>
      <button onClick={() => count.set(count.value + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Data Flow Mapping
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Duplicated state
const [userProfile, setUserProfile] = useState()
const [userName, setUserName] = useState()
const [userEmail, setUserEmail] = useState()

// ✅ Good: Single source of truth
const userState = createState({
  name: 'John',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  avatar: '/avatar.jpg'
})

const userName = createComputed(() => userState.value.name)
const userEmail = createComputed(() => userState.value.email)
```
